        <p>
          Vaasa is a city on the west coast of Finland. It received its charter
          in 1606, during the reign of Charles IX of Sweden and is named after
          the Royal House of Vasa. Vaasa has a population of 67,447
          (approximately 120,000 in the Vaasa sub-region), and is the regional
          capital of Ostrobothnia (Swedish: Ã–sterbotten; Finnish: Pohjanmaa).
          Vaasa is also well-known as a major university and college city in
          Finland. The city is bilingual with 69.8% of the population speaking
          Finnish as their first language and 24.8% speaking Swedish. The
          surrounding Ostrobothnian municipalities (such as Korsholm and Malax)
          have a clear Swedish-speaking majority, which is why the Swedish
          language maintains a strong position in the city, making it the most
          significant cultural center for Swedish-Finns. Vaasa is also known for
          Tropiclandia Water Park, which is located in the Vaskiluoto Island
          right next to a local spa hotel. In the immediate vicinity of
          Tropiclandia was the now deserted Wasalandia Amusement Park, which
          ceased operations in 2015 due to a small number of visitors.
