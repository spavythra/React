        <h2>Jyväskylä</h2>
        <p>
          Jyväskylä is a city and municipality in Finland in the western part of
          the Finnish Lakeland. It is located about 150 km north-east from
          Tampere, the third largest city in Finland; and about 270 km north
          from Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The Jyväskylä sub-region
          includes Jyväskylä, Hankasalmi, Laukaa, Muurame, Petäjävesi, Toivakka,
          and Uurainen. Other border municipalities of Jyväskylä are Joutsa,
          Jämsä and Luhanka. Jyväskylä is the largest city in the region of
          Central Finland and in the Finnish Lakeland; as of 31 March 2021,
          Jyväskylä had a population of 143,400. The city has been one of the
          fastest growing cities in Finland during the 20th century, when in
          1940, there were only 8,000 inhabitants in Jyväskylä. Elias Lönnrot,
          the compiler of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, gave the city
          the nickname "Athens of Finland". This nickname refers to the major
          role of Jyväskylä as an educational centre. The works of the most
          famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto can be seen throughout the city.
          The city hosts the Neste Oil Rally Finland, which is part of the World
          Rally Championship. It is also home of the annual Jyväskylä Arts
          Festival.
